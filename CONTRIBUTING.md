# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in the project! I definitely am interested in feedback and ideas on things for this
project around formatting, emoji used, etc. Feel free to file issues to discuss changes!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Picking a feature or issue
Before you start working on something please **let us know** what you are planning to do first! Comment on the issue or create a new issue first so we prevent people from working on the same thing!

## Project setup

You're going to need [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) to get the project, and [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies and run scripts. Check out the [Development](https://github.com/bunqCommunity/bunqDesktop#development) section on the readme for more details

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run `yarn` in the repo directory to install dependencies
4. Create a branch for your PR
5. Optionally, if your PR includes code changes make sure to run `yarn run prettier` to ensure the project follows the codestyle as much as possible
